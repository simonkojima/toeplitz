# toeplitz

This is originally from https://github.com/trichter/toeplitz  
Function ccg and cccg was removed from original package since it throw error while building.
For using the package [blockmatrix](https://github.com/jsosulski/blockmatrix), toeplitzlda.ctg_sl() is only required. Which means, these functions are not required for running [blockmatrix](https://github.com/jsosulski/blockmatrix) and [toeplitzlda](https://github.com/jsosulski/toeplitzlda).
